---

##  Dependencies Installed

```bash
npm install next-auth@latest @vercel/postgres bcryptjs @types/bcryptjs
```

---

##  Local Development (No Cloud)

**No additional setup needed!** The app works perfectly with localStorage alone:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to:
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Analytics**: `http://localhost:3000/analytics`

All data is saved locally in your browser.

---

##  Cloud Sync Setup (Optional)

If you want multi-device sync, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enable Vercel Postgres

1. Deploy to Vercel (if not already):
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

2. In Vercel Dashboard:
   - Go to your project → **Storage** tab
   - Click **Create Database** → Select **Postgres**
   - Choose the free **Hobby** plan

3. After creation, copy the **DATABASE_URL** from the **.env.local** tab

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in your project root (already created, just update values):

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgres://default:xxx@xxx.vercel-storage.com:5432/verceldb"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="generate-this-with-openssl-rand-base64-32"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Change to production URL when deployed
```

**Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET**:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Step 3: Run Database Schema

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Storage → Your Postgres Database
2. Click on **Query** tab
3. Copy contents of `lib/db/schema.sql` and execute it

This creates all necessary tables (users, transactions, recurring_transactions, budget_goals, savings_goals).

### Step 4: Deploy

```bash
# Add environment variables to Vercel
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Step 5: Use Cloud Features

- Navigate to `/signup` to create an account
- Sign in at `/signin`
- Your data will automatically sync across devices!

---

##  Database Schema

Tables created:
- **users**: User accounts with hashed passwords
- **transactions**: All income/expense transactions
- **recurring_transactions**: Recurring transaction templates
- **budget_goals**: Budget limits by category and period
- **savings_goals**: Savings targets with progress tracking

See `lib/db/schema.sql` for full schema.

---

##  Features Overview

### Recurring Transactions
1. Click "Create Recurring Transaction" on dashboard
2. Set amount, frequency, start/end dates
3. Transactions auto-generate on schedule
4. Pause anytime without deleting

### Analytics Dashboard
1. Navigate to **Analytics** from header
2. View financial health score (aim for 80+!)
3. Track spending trends by category
4. See month-over-month comparisons

### Cloud Sync (When Enabled)
- Data backed up to cloud automatically
- Access from any device
- Offline changes sync when reconnected
- Export still works as backup

---

##   Configuration

### Without Cloud (Default)
- Data stored in localStorage
- Works offline
- No account needed
- Export CSV for backups

### With Cloud (Optional)
- Requires Vercel Postgres
- Multi-device sync
- Account required
- Automatic backups

---

##  Important Notes

1. **Data Migration**: When you first enable cloud sync and sign in, your localStorage data will automatically migrate to the cloud

2. **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in `.gitignore`)

3. **Free Tier Limits** (Vercel Postgres Hobby):
   - 256 MB storage
   - 60 hours compute/month
   - Perfect for personal use!

4. **Backwards Compatible**: All features work without cloud sync enabled

---

##  Troubleshooting

### "Database connection failed"
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly in `.env.local`
- Verify Vercel Postgres is created and running
- Make sure schema.sql has been executed

### "Failed to sign in"
- Check `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your domain
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### "Transactions not syncing"
- Ensure you're signed in
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API routes are accessible
